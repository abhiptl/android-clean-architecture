/**
 * Created by WeConnect on 10/4/17.
 * <p/>
 * This abstract class implements some common methods for all interactors. Cancelling an interactor, check if its running
 * and finishing an interactor has mostly the same code throughout so that is why this class was created. Field methods
 * are declared volatile as we might use these methods from different threads (mainly from UI).
 * <p/>
 * For example, when an activity is getting destroyed then we should probably cancel an interactor
 * but the request will come from the UI thread unless the request was specifically assigned to a background thread.

	 * This method contains the actual business logic of the interactor. It SHOULD NOT BE USED DIRECTLY but, instead, a

	 * <p/>
	 * This method should only be called directly while doing unit/integration tests. That is the only reason it is declared
	 * public as to help with easier testing.
